### Enterprise-grade Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for secure, local-first LLM integration with proprietary SQL and CSV data.

**NOTE:** Every line of code typed by a human manually.

In 2026, data privacy is the primary barrier to AI adoption.

**Asymmetric Security:** Data stays within the local infrastructure; only metadata and specific query results are shared with the LLM.

**Robust Integration:** Built using the official MCP Python SDK and SQLAlchemy for database-agnostic performance (SQL, PostgreSQL, CSV).

**Zero-Cloud Footprint:** No data is sent to third-party vectors unless explicitly configured.

**MCP Resource Templates:** Exposes database schemas as readable resources for LLM context.

**Dynamic Tooling:** Allows LLMs to execute secure, read-only SQL queries via natural language.

**Audit Logging:** Every query and data access event is logged for compliance.
